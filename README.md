This project appears to be a web application that provides weather information based on user-provided location data or the user's current location.
It seems to be structured using JavaScript and contains several modules and functionalities:
Location Handling: It allows users to get weather information for their current location or a specific location they search for.
Search Integration: Users can input a location in a search field, and the application fetches weather information for that location.
Weather Data Display: The application displays current weather information, highlights (such as air quality, humidity, pressure), and a 24-hour and 5-day weather forecast.
Timezone Handling: It accounts for the timezone of the location to display accurate time-related data.
Air Quality Index (AQI): It provides the Air Quality Index along with related air quality information.
User Interface (UI): It has a responsive user interface that adapts to mobile devices.
